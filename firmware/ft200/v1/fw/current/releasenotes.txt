v0.6.1.1	7/3/2023	Add offline logging viewer & signboard logging related updates
				Code 35 override for locals but not individual flags. We choose Code35 because it is the safer of the available conditions in all local instances.
				Fix bug in FT200 local zone wireless reporting where FT200 may show a local condition even in an overriden state such as full course red. This matches local to reported wireless condition.
v0.6.1.2	7/4/2023	Change blue flag condition to only render on signboard FT200s
v0.6.1.3	7/14/2023	Change flag reporting in pits back to matching full course condition, as it was previously "flag state 16" and unrecognized by track director and the car bubble would show white in the pits, regardless of full track condition.
v0.6.1.4	3/14/2023	Changed individual flag interaction with Code35, as Code35 logic update from v0.6.1.3 had Code35 overriding individual black flag, meatball and pit messages. It is now set so that Code35 overrides locals, but not individual flags.
